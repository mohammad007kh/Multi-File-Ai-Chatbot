# Multi-File AI Chatbot with Memory and Document Summarization

A Streamlit app that lets you chat with the content of your uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, images) using AI, with conversational memory, document summaries, and retrieval-augmented generation. Now powered by GPT-4o-mini and LangGraph.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-file upload:** Supports PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG, JPEG.
- **Conversational memory:** Remembers previous chat turns for context.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Answers are based only on your uploaded files.
- **OCR for images:** Extracts text from images using the OCR.space API.
- **Document summarization for images:** Uses GPT-4o-mini to summarize and categorize each uploaded image file (not PDFs or DOCX).
- **Chunk filtering:** Ignores text chunks shorter than 50 characters for better relevance.
- **Chunk indexing:** Each chunk is indexed and shown in the preview for clarity.
- **Privacy:** No files or chat data are stored.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **API Key errors:** Make sure your keys are correct and active.
- **OCR issues:** Some images may not be readable; try higher quality scans.
- **File size:** Very large files may take longer to process.
